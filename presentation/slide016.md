        Workflow

        • gco -b my-feature-name
        • work on your branch:
        • frequent small commits
        • diff before commiting to check
        • use amend if needed
        • concise & meaningful commit messages
        • when work is done, check if any clean up is needed
        • use interactive rebase to squash/remove/edit commits
        • push to remote
        • open a "pull request" on github (as in "I want you to pull in my changes")
        • if merge to master is not trivial: back-merge or rebase your branch
        • after rebase push with force (only your branch)
        • NEVER force push master/production or any branch which is shared with others
